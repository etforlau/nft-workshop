# Workshop for crafting NFT

This project contains 2 Solidity smart contracts. ERC-1155 standard became the one, which was chosen to be implemented.
"ManuvantaraCollection.sol" has definition for fungible and non-fungible tokens; mints them; keeps track of wallets and amount of tokens they have. It was designed only for owner to work with it, since all main functions are in another contract.<br />
"Workshop.sol" is aimed for users and contains all main functions.
